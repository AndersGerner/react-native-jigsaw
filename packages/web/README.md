# @draftbit/web

You're probably looking for
[`@draftbit/ui`](https://github.com/draftbit/react-native-jigsaw/tree/master/packages/ui#readme).

`@draftbit/web` is used internally at Draftbit. It is unlikely you need to
install it, or modify these files, unless you want to use `@draftbit/ui`
components in a create-react-app project.
